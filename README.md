# Movie-Prediction-Analysis-with-SAS

We used supervised learning (Decision Tree, Neural Network, Logistic Regression) and Unsupervised learning (Association Rules, Clustering) to answer the following business questions:
1. Based on a personâ€™s characteristics, can we predict whether they will like a movie or not? 
2. Based on previous ratings, can we recommend a movie? 
3. Based on the movie genres, can we recommend certain genre?
4. What are the similarities between people that watch certain kind of movie? Can we recommend movies based on this similarities?
